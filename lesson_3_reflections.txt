When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would do this when collaborating with others on a project or you know you're going to use multiple devices
to work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to decide what is pulled and to where and at what time. Git might
mess with what you are currently working on.
