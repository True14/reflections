When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would do this when collaborating with others on a project or you know you're going to use multiple devices
to work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to decide what is pulled and to where and at what time. Git might
mess with what you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are basically clones, but they are copied repositories from github to github.
Clones are copied repositories from github to you local machine. Branches are
separate paths stemming from a single commit. It's not a matter of using one over
the other. They all serve different purposes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is knowing how things stand if anything happens while you're offline.
You have a nice history of what you were working from and what changed while you
weren't connected to the internet.
